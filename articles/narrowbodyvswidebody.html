            <h1>Narrow-body vs. Wide-body aircraft</h1>
            <p>
                Which one is more superior?

            <h2>What is a narrow-body and a wide-body aircraft?</h2>
            <p>
                A narrow-body, or a single-aisle aircraft by definition is an airliner arranged along a single aisle, permitting up to 6-abreast seating in the cabin. In contrast, a wide-body, or a twin-aisle aircraft, is an airliner with a wider fuselage, allowing for two aisles of seats, with passengers seating on 7 to abreast per row.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern narrow-body airliners, like the Boeing 737 or the Airbus A320, have a fuselage width of 3.5 to 4.5 meters (11 to 15 ft). In contrast, modern wide-body airliners, like the Boeing 777 or the Airbus A350, have a fuselage width of 5.5 to 6.5 meters (18 to 21 ft).
            </p>
            <h2>Now that we have the definitions out of the way, let's get into the details.</h2>
            <p>
                A bigger plane means it needs a bigger runway. This means that a wide-body aircraft can only land in airports with a longer runway, meanwhile a narrow-body aircraft can land in airports with a shorter runway. Airports with a longer runway are usually international airports, so thats why you can also see that wide-body aircraft also serve international routes. While narrow-body aircraft are usually used for domestic routes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, there is no 'superior' aircraft. It all depends on the route and the airport.
